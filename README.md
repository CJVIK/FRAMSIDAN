## Commit-regler

- Subject + body using Vim-formatted commit messages
- Capital letter in beginning of subject line
- Commit should contain a _what_ and _why_. For example, place the _what_ in subject line, and the _why_ in body
- Clear signalling words in beginning of subject line: update, add, delete

## Git-flow

- No pushes to main or dev, branches only
- Feature-branches syntax: f-<part-name>-<task-category> (i.e f-footer-styling); kebab-case

## PR-rutiner

- Follow commit rules in the message about pull request
- Create pull request for finished features to be merged
- Reviewer checks code using checklist (definition of done)
  - If problems: leave comment/request changes in the pull request
  - Else: approve and merge

## Definition of Done

- [] Good variable names:
  - camelCase
  - Purposeful names - easy to understand
- [] Validating inputs
- [] Semantic HTML
  - Self-sustained containers: article
  - Dependant containers: section
  - Other containers: div
- []
